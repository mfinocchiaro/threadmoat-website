## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| next-intl for i18n | App Router native, cookie-based locale detection | ✓ Good |
| localePrefix: as-needed | English at /, no redirect to /en | ✓ Good |
| intlMiddleware outside auth() | Prevents rewrite→redirect on Vercel edge | ✓ Good |
| Forge→Analyst, Red Keep→Strategist | Business partners preferred professional tier names | ✓ Good |
| Analyst as one-time, Strategist as annual | Matches actual product offering — report vs subscription | ✓ Good |
| React Email + Resend | Official companion, JSX templates, Resend already in use | ✓ Good |
| Skip Asian languages | Different infrastructure requirements | — Pending |
| Add Portuguese | Brazil industrial market, 270M speakers | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition:**
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone:**
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
